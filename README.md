The game also introduces contraptions, which are special abilities that BJ can acquire from the halfway point of the game. There are three contraptions to choose from: the Ram Shackles, which allow you to ram through walls and enemies; the Battle Walker, which allow you to extend your legs and reach higher places; and the Constrictor Harness, which allow you to squeeze through narrow spaces. Each contraption has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you can switch between them at any time.
     
The game also features stealth elements, which allow you to sneak past enemies or take them out silently. You can use cover, lean around corners, crawl under objects, or use suppressed weapons to avoid detection. You can also perform melee takedowns or throw hatchets at enemies for instant kills. However, if you are spotted by an enemy or an alarm is triggered, the game will switch to a more action-oriented mode, where you have to fight your way out of the situation.
